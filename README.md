# stable-diffusion

A collection of colabs that I maintain for myself while playing with Stable Diffusion and other AI models. Do register an Issue if you encounter problems with any of the notebooks here, everything is updating everywhere and all the time lately so things easily fall apart unless being maintained at a weekly basis.

## You want to train your model with high quality

Trust me, there are so much to learn and understand so unless you have the time for this I recommend trying Joe Penna's notebook and just accomodate whatever tips he has while running the notebook. Thinking hmmm I wonder what could improve the quality is a road that will take time with small rewards even no rewards :D

Super easy demonstration of Stable Diffusion and Dreambooth. In under 60 minutes you will have trained your model and created 100+ AI images as I have automated the entire process, so unless the internet have broken again you should be ready for a treat. So if you are OK with not having to understand what an LLM, a transformer, machine learning, diffusion models, python or any of the technical fancy pancy details... then lets go! 

**prerequisites**

- A Google Drive account, comes with any Google accounts. You can register one for free if you do not already have one.
- A huggingface token, read token will do but write token if you want to save the trained model.
- 6 or 8 images of the subject you want to train.

Time from start to end: an hour of your time

Have fun!

Version v1.5: _Installation of libraries verified with Colab Pro._  
Version v1.4: _Installation of libraries verified with Colab Pro, does not work anymore with free Colab._  
Version v1.3: _Like a glove update. Added checks for crashed notebooks, notifying user of replaying cell containing all needed values. Added more error detection for situations things dont work out as planned... in colab world more often than not..._  
Version v1.2: _AutoAI maintained for gender, checkpoint file created earlier and model card for upload is detailed now._  
Version v1.1: _Added model selection._  
Version v1.0: _Initial notebook_

Enhance or super zoom, in reality it's more like a full reverse. Needless to say, you can create some zoom effects with this colab.
